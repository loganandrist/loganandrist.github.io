    <h1>Reading</h1>
    <p>One of my favortite hobbies is reading! I've always loved to read since I was in elementary school.</h2>
    <p> The book I'm currently reading happens to be the very first book to the Harry Potter series. <p>
    <p> Since the fall season is right around the corner, it's only fitting that Harry Potter was the series I read again. <p>

  <h1> Competing in Bodybuilding</h1>
    </p> Another hobby I love is going to the gym and competing in bodybuilding!</p>
    </p> I compete in women's bikini bodybuilding, and last Novemeber I got first place in my division. </p>
  <h1>Thrifting</h1>
    <p> Another hobby of mine is to discover new antique malls and thrift stores and shop around.</p>
    <p>I like to call it "retail therapy".</p>
