    <h1>Reading</h1>
    <p>One of my favortite hobbies is reading! I've always loved to read since I was in elementary school.</h2>
    <p> The book I'm currently reading happens to be the very first book to the Harry Potter series. <p>
    <p> Since the fall season is right around the corner, it's only fitting that Harry Potter was the series I read again. <p>

  <h1> Competing in Bodybuilding</h1>
    </p> Another hobby I love is going to the gym and competing in bodybuilding!</p>
    </p> I compete in women's bikini bodybuilding, and last Novemeber I got first place in my division. </p>
  <br>
  <h1>Thrifting</h1>
    <p> Another hobby of mine is to discover new antique malls and thrift stores and shop around.</p>
    <p>I like to call it "retail therapy".</p>

  <h1>How did I use GitHub's features to build this website?</h1>
  <p>GitHub has features such as repositiories, branches, and the commit button.</p>
  <p>Think of the repository as the folder for a project (your website url).</p>
  <p>I used the repository to store, update, and change anything about this website.</p>
  <p>The repository can be represented by the last piece to a website's URL, which in this case is "index.html".</p>
  <p>This indicates this is the default web page accessed when first visiting this site. Sort of like a home page!</p>
  <p>The branch of GitHub refers to a seperate section of your web page that you can edit and change without changing the original version.</p>
  <p>In this situation, I can go to a brnach of my web page, edit and change any of the HTML code I want, and either decide to change the orin=ginal after, or deisregard it.</p>
  <p>It's important to note that when I do accept (commit) changes, the two branches merge to create one web page with the new changes.</p>
  <p>Lastely I used the 'commit' button to save and verify all of the changes I want to make to my web page.</p>
  <p>After I'm done entering my code, I'll press 'commit' to verify the changes I've made and update the original web page.</p>
  <p>It will also give me the option to add additional descriptions to my web page for further details if desired.</p>
